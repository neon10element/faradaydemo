# Pull Demo
## Start on GitHub
1) Creating a Read Me file on GitHub.
2) Saving the file as a commit on GitHub.
3) Using GitHub's online editor to update/change the Read Me file.
4) Cloning the repo on GitHub then pulling it down to use locally.
## Next on IntelliJ locally
1) Using the command line, open the destination folder in IntelliJ.
2) Enter commands: clone and paste repository location copied from GitHub.
## Git Branching
1) The main (default) branch is the same as its feature branch initially.
2) Use command line git init to initiate a new feature branch.
3) Any changes to the feature branch will not appear on the main branch.
4) Use command line git diff to compare changes to the feature branch to the main branch.
5) Work with diff while signed onto the main (default) branch.
